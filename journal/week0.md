## Required Homework
### Installing the AWS CLI
I attempted installing doing this using the frollowing instructions:

```
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws

```
However, I get the following error:

```
/usr/bin/env: ‘python’: No such file or directory
```
I'm still busy troubleshooting. Should be able to figure it out. Will update this doc when I have completed this task
